# ProstateCancerClassifier

Prostate cancer starts in the cells of the prostates
and this is the most common type of cancer that happen in
Canadian men. We will see some introduction about cancer
and problems that we are trying to solve in our project. The
project is focused on classifying given datasets of Prostate
cancer to find meaningful information like biomarkers. To
perform different operations, we are provided with two datasets
that contain clinical and gene data of prostate cancer. Datasets
are merged and Feature selection is done using Tree-based
feature selection method by which we extracted n-number of
features from 60484 features. We tried to visualize the data by
doing dimensionality reduction using PCA to 3 dimensions.
We performed Undersampling/Oversampling/Combination of
Under and Oversampling as the classes were imbalanced.
Finally, to obtain useful information from this dataset, different
classifications methods such as K-NN, Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Random Forest were used. After classification, each
classifierâ€™s performance was evaluated based on the accuracy
score.
